# TODO List

## TODO

 - [ ] better exit for thread pool deletion (May need to refactor, further investigation is required)

## In Progress..?
 - [x] no memory leak? (when the program reaches the endpoint successfully, there is no leak. No guaranteed is given if it ends prematurely)

## Done but could clean up
 - [x] masterThread?
 - [x] collector
 - [x] Makefile (It's a bit raw in the header dependency area)
 - [x] Project structure


## Done
 - [x] main
 - [x] thread pool (May need to refactor)
 - [x] sum function
 - [x] collector main (Any potential issue should be on the worker thread side)
 - [x] collector result management
 - [x] collector printing thread
